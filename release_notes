- Lamp Squid of this release:
Breaking map scripts by commenting out to much. Idea: Have a handy output when a script
doesn't work as intended, but make said output appear only in times when one is searching
really hard for that nasty squid.

Attempt:
```
#ifdef DESQUID_MORE
if( !loadMapObject( cur ) ) {
    IO::printMessage( "SMO fail" );
}
#endif
```

Result: Scripts magically cannot load new map objects anymore. Turns out, "loading" a map
object is very beneficial to it actually appearing on-screen. Fix:

```
if( !loadMapObject( cur ) ) {
#ifdef DESQUID_MORE
    IO::printMessage( "SMO fail" );
#endif
}
```
