Pokémon _neo_
===========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/neo-engine/neo.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/neo-engine/neo)

An experimental Pokémon engine for Nintendo DS. For demonstration purposes only, currently
_neo_ includes some (updated) maps from Pokémon Emerald, as well as images from other
mainline Pokémon games. These are not part of _neo_.

This engine is intended to be run on real hardware, but [DeSmuME 0.9.11](http://desmume.org/) and melonDS seem to be capable of emulating most of real hardware's features, too.

Build requirements
------------------
* devkitARM ≥ r54
* libnds ≥ 1.8.1
* libfilesystem ≥ 0.9.14
* libfat-nds ≥ 1.1.5
* dswifi ≥ 0.4.2 (currently unused)
* maxmod-nds ≥ 1.0.14

* gcc/g++ ≥ 10.0

* make

Having installed the above tools, _neo_ can be built with a single `make` command. The
optional make parameter `DESQUID=1` enables the desquid mode; the parameter `NOSOUND=1` disables any sound of the complied ROM image (which makes it run much more stable on HW).

The main data for the maps, 'mons, etc, is stored in the separate `perm2-FSROOT`
repository; some data can be configured and build via tools and `csv` files found in the
`perm2-fsdata` repository.

Further helper scripts to convert images and other data can be found in the `perm2-helper`
repository.
